# JS and data structures

Let's start with a quote that once changed my life. I am sure that this quote and its understanding will also change yours, if you have not heard about it yet.

> Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships. &copy; [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds)

We will talk about data structures, but it is impossible to talk about data structures without mentioning algorithms. So let's talk about both things.

Algorithm is the steps we need to take to solve a problem. Data structures are organized data with efficient and convenient access to them.

Out of the box JS has two data structures â€” `Array` and `Hash Table` (`Object`, `Set`, `Map`). Not much, but based on these two, it is possible to build almost any other structures (`Queue`, `Enum`, `Linked List`, `Graphs` and etc.).

Let's get started. We will start with the `Linked List`.

**`Linked List`** â€” the data structure that consists of a group of nodes which... wait, wait, wait. I am sure `Linked List` is a great structure that solves the problems, but today I want to talk about `simpler`, `useful` and `everyday` structures that will make your life easier. Namely about `Enum` and `Map`.

We will talk about these two data structures, look at the conventions that JS community has about them: how to call them, how to compose them and how they help us solve our everyday problems.

(Also, If you want to know more about the other data structures that I mentioned above (hope so) but which we will not talk about today, you can take a look at [this](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/10-common-data-structures-explained-with-videos-exercises-aaff6c06fb2b) article. I am sure that the guys from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) explain these structures better than me ðŸ™‚)
